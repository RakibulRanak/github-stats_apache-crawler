Create a script that can get statistics from all the GitHub repositories of Kaggle
(https://github.com/Kaggle). Specifically, the script should generate a report (in a format that you
prefer) with the following information for all the repositories found under the Kaggle account.

• Total and median number of commits, stars, contributors, branches, tags, forks, releases,
closed issues, and environments (please use the GitHub’ API to perform this task).

• It should print out the total and median number of source code lines per programming
languages used from all the repositories of Kaggle (you are not allowed to use the GitHub
API for this part, but you may use any other tool or library).
